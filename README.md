#Memberlite: An Easy to Customize Theme for Membership Sites
===

##Getting Started
---------------

Memberlite makes it easy to customize the appearance and layout of your site using the Theme Customization Screen (Appearance > Customize). 

###Adding Your Logo
Use the Appearance Header Screen to add a Custom Header logo (formatted for retina display) and to toggle the display of header text and text color.

[Explore Documentation on Custom Headers in Memberlite](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/themes/memberlite/adding-your-logo/)

###Customize the Theme
Use the Customize Screen to modify theme layout, logo, fonts, colors, copyright message and more.

[Explore Documentation on Customizing Memberlite »](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/themes/memberlite/customize-the-theme/)

###Using Child Themes
If you need to customize the theme beyond the settings in "Customize", use a child theme.
